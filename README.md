# devconnect

This project was a learning exercise for the MERN stack. It is a developer oriented social media site complete with registration, profiles, posts and likes. The backend API was build with Node.js + Express and was integrated into a React frontend using Redux for app state management and authentication was handled with JSON Web Tokens.

It is hosted [here](https://castor-devconnector.herokuapp.com) or can be ran locally with the following commands

```
npm install
npm run client-install
npm run dev
```

You will need your own keys_dev.js file in the config directory with a mongoURI and secret provided.
